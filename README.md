## Overview

GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows are usually characterized as deterministic mappings from **isometric Gaussian** latent codes to images. 
We show that it is possible to unify various diffusion models into this formulation. 
This allows us to guide (or condition, control) various generative models in a **unified, plug-and-play manner** by leveraging latent-space energy-based models (EBMs). 
This repository provides a unified interface for guiding various generative models with CLIP, classifiers, and face IDs.

Interestingly, we find that different models represent subpopulations and individuals in different ways, although most of them are trained on the same data.
